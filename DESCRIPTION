Description: A collection of Bayesian models and helpful data simulation tools
    intended for analyzing data that contain chronological uncertainty. These
    tools are primarily built for use by Palaeo Scientists (e.g.,
    archaeologists, palaeoclimatologists, palaeontologists, etc.), but they may
    be of use to data scientists in any field where significant measurement
    uncertainties are common in both dependent and independent variables.
